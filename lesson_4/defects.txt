Defect Report for StringUtils Class

1. Method `capitilize` is misspelled; should be `capitalize`.
2. Method `delete_symbol` uses a method `contains` which is not defined in the class.
3. Method `to_list` does not handle cases where the delimiter is not found correctly.
4. Method `list_to_string` does not handle non-string types in the list.
